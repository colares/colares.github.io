![Hello World](/assets/img/2019-02-24-react-npm-pkg/react-npm-pkg.png)

So you have just created a nice React package. Let's make it available to the world as an npm package.  

**I'm assuming that** you have Node 8.10.0 or later on your local development machine, but is not required on the server. And that you know some basics on JavaScript and React.

# 1. Create a new React app using `create-react-app`

    npx create-react-app my-unique-pkg-name
    
Note that I have just called the `npx` command (not `npm`). `npx` is a **package runner** which executes Node packages without installing them. `npx` comes with npm 5.2+ and higher.

# 2. Delete all files inside `src/`
So we can start as minimal as possible.

# 3. Create a new `index.js` file inside `src/`
This index file is not part of the React package per se. But it is going to be useful as a usage example of it. I am going to resume this topic in a few lines.

<figure>
  <figcaption>src/index.js</figcaption>
{% highlight jsx %}
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ReactDOM.render(<div>Hi index</div>, document.querySelector("#root"));
{% endhighlight %}
</figure>

**Baby steps!** At this point, you should see something on the browser by running:

    npm start

![Hello World](/assets/img/2019-02-24-react-npm-pkg/react-lib-01-hi-index.png)
 
# 4. Create a component

Create a new folder `src/lib`. That is where all your React package code is going to live. Inside this folder, create a React component:

<figure>
  <figcaption>src/lib/UkuleleChord.js</figcaption>
{% highlight jsx %}
import React from 'react';

const UkuleleChord = () => {
    return <div>I'm a Ukulele Chord</div>
};

export default UkuleleChord;

{% endhighlight %}
</figure>

# 5. Use an `index.js` file to group exports
As you create multiple files in your package, it is a common best practice to have an `index.js` file as a way to create explicit public interfaces.

I prefer a file to contain only one export. That's why I usually use default exports. Thus I can use an index.js to group functions and expose them as [named exports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export#Using_named_exports).

Create a new file `index.js` inside `src/lib`:

<figure>
  <figcaption>src/lib/index.js</figcaption>
{% highlight jsx %}
import UkuleleChord from './UkuleleChord';
export { UkuleleChord };
{% endhighlight %}
</figure>

# 6. Update the usage example
Import the component you have just created and check if it is working.

<figure>
  <figcaption>src/index.js</figcaption>
{% highlight jsx %}
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import { UkuleleChord } from "./lib";

ReactDOM.render(
    <div>Hi index
        <UkuleleChord/>
    </div>,
    document.querySelector("#root")
);
{% endhighlight %}
</figure>

# 7. Install Babel
Babel is a JavaScript transpiler. It translates code from modern JavaScript to extensively-supported old versions so our program can safely run on older browsers. [More about Babel installation](https://babeljs.io/en/setup/#installation).

    npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli
    
### What does @ stands for?
Packages whose name is preceded by the symbol @ are called [scoped packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope). Scopes are a way of grouping related packages together and also affect a few things about the way npm treats the package.

# 8. Create the `.babelrc` file

<figure>
  <figcaption>project_root_folder/.babelrc</figcaption>
{% highlight json %}
{
  "presets": [["react-app"]]
}
{% endhighlight %}
</figure>

[Babelâ€™s presets](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/presets) works as pre-defined array of Babel plugins. The `react-app` is defined by [babel-preset-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-react-app), a package that includes the Babel preset used by Create React App.

# 9. Change the default build task
Replace the default `build` task inside `package.json` with the following:
<figure>
  <figcaption>project_root_folder/package.json</figcaption>
{% highlight json %}
"build": "rm -rf dist && NODE_ENV=production babel src/lib --out-dir dist --copy-files --ignore __tests__,spec.js,test.js,__snapshots__"
{% endhighlight %}
</figure>

The `--copy-files --ignore ...` section of the build task is optional so far. It will make more sense as you implement automatic testing (recommended).

### Why should I replace the default build task?
The Create React App's default `build` task ([see the complete code here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/scripts/build.js)) pack more stuffs than we need until now. See for yourself. 

The dist folder after running the default build task:

    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ asset-manifest.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.ico
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
    â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ precache-manifest.2c65f44cf26f9872347e77194a34367c.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ service-worker.js
    â””â”€â”€ static
        â””â”€â”€ js
            â”œâ”€â”€ 2.35781443.chunk.js
            â”œâ”€â”€ 2.35781443.chunk.js.map
            â”œâ”€â”€ main.857353e4.chunk.js
            â”œâ”€â”€ main.857353e4.chunk.js.map
            â”œâ”€â”€ runtime~main.fdfcfda2.js
            â””â”€â”€ runtime~main.fdfcfda2.js.map

After running the suggested build task:

    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
    â””â”€â”€ UkuleleChord.js

Leaner. On the flip side, the files are not being minified (which reduces file size and improves performance) nor adding hashes to it's names (which may force dependents to update the assets). I recommend you to try to add these and other features.

# 10. Publish the package to the npm registry

Add the following lines to the `package.json`

<figure>
  <figcaption>project_root_folder/package.json</figcaption>
{% highlight json %}
"main": "dist/index.js",
"module": "dist/index.js",
"files": [
  "dist",
  "README.md"
],
"repository": {
  "type": "git",
  "url": "https://my-repository"
}
{% endhighlight %}
</figure>

Create you npm account by visiting https://www.npmjs.com/signup

Sign in via command-line interface ([see all CLI commands](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli-documentation/cli)):

    $ npm adduser
    
Respond to prompts:

    Username: yourusername
    Password: 
    Email: (this IS public) yourpublicemail@example.com
    Logged in as yourusername on https://registry.npmjs.org/.
 
Check if you are logged in:

    $ npm whoami 
    yourusername

Publish the package to the npm registry:

    $ npm publish
    npm notice 
    npm notice ðŸ“¦ my-unique-pkg-name@0.1.0
    npm notice === Tarball Contents === 
    npm notice 869B  package.json        
    npm notice 2.9kB README.md           
    npm notice 67B   dist/index.js       
    npm notice 176B  dist/UkuleleChord.js
    npm notice === Tarball Details === 
    npm notice name:          my-unique-pkg-name-joston               
    npm notice version:       0.1.0                                   
    npm notice package size:  1.9 kB                                  
    npm notice unpacked size: 4.0 kB                                  
    npm notice shasum:        8d1bbe4469f8f1d22950240fc4edf98250e5cc34
    npm notice integrity:     sha512-7U4nIDmtZ9E5B[...]LNr56439metIQ==
    npm notice total files:   4                                       
    npm notice 
    + my-unique-pkg-name@0.1.0

Done! Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

### Important basic notes on npm registry
* The name of your package have to be globally unique
* Understanding [semantic versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning) is vital to npm registry
    * It is going to ease the deployment of new versions and prevent users from unintended updates
